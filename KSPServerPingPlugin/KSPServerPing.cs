     * This project is meant to be a "Hello World" example showing how to make a part-less plugin.
     * 
     * The main class for your plug-in should implement MonoBehavior, which is a Unity class.
     * http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html
     * 
     * KSPAddon is an "attribute" that lets KSP know that this class is a plug-in. KSP will create
     * an instance of the class whenever the game loads the specified scene. The second parameter
     * tells KSP whether to create an instance once, or every time it loads the scene.
     * 
     * Do not use true for the second parameter until this bug gets fixed:
     * http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45107-KSPAddon-bug-causes-mod-incompatibilities
     * That link has a workaround, but prefer to use false unless your needs dictate otherwise.
     * 
     * The lifecycle for KSP comes from Unity with a few differences:
     *    
     *    Constructor -> Awake() -> Start() -> Update/FixedUpdate() [repeats] -> OnDestroy()
     * 
     * When the specified game scene loads, first KSP will construct your MonoBehaviour class and
     * call Awake(). When it finishes doing that for all the mods, then it calls Start(). After
     * that, it will call Update() every frame and FixedUpdate() every physics time step. Just
     * before exiting the scene, the game will call OnDestroy() which gives you the opportunity to
     * save any settings.
     * 
     * Unity uses Serialization a lot, so use the Awake() method to initialize your fields rather
     * than the constructor. And you can use OnDestroy() to do some of the things you would do in
     * a destructor.
     * 
     * Also see http://www.richardfine.co.uk/2012/10/unity3d-monobehaviour-lifecycle/ for more
     * information about the Unity lifecycle.
     * 
     * This plugin does not actually do anything beyond logging to the Debug console, which you
     * can access by pressing Alt+F2 or Alt+F12 (on Windows, for OSX use Opt and for Linux use
     * Right Shift). You can also look at the debug file, which you can find at
     * {KSP}/KSP_Data/output_log.txt.
